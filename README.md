# VR-Solo-Project
VR Project Source Code

Forest Invasion is a solo project I completed at the University of Baltimore for Game 440 in one and a half months. It was a great learning experience to develop a VR game using a VR headset, learn how UI works in VR, and implement haptic feedback with the Oculus Quest 2 controller. For the project, I have completed:
- 5 weapons, each with a different bullet, muzzle flash, and VFX.
- Timer .
- Post-processing feedback when player gets hurt.
- Player Health System.
- Player Score Keeper & High Score Keeper.
- Interactive UI Menu and Weapon Ammo display UI.
- Enemy Spawner.
- Simple Enemy AI nave mesh agent.
